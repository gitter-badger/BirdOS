BirdOS is an operating system developed for hobbies and science based on [BlogOS](https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os) by Philipp Oppermann. BirdOS is a very simple system so it should not be considered as a full fledged operating system. Currently BirdOS is under heavy development so both the system and the documentation is not perfect and not everything will always work.

# DEMO
Below you will find screen view of the current version of the system:
